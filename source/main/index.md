I am currently a NLP Engineer at Wells Fargo.

I was formerly a Computer Science Masters Student at the
[Robotic Embedded Systems Laboratory][RESL]
at the [University of Southern California][USC].
I spend alot of time thinking about these things:

+ Artificial Intelligence
+ Machine Learning / Reinforcement Learning
+ Linux

Here is my [resume](./data/amlesh_curriculum_vitae.pdf) if you're intersted.

This site doesn't really having anything except a link to my GitHub profile.
Hopefully that will change in the future.

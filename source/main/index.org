I am currently a NLP Engineer at Wells Fargo.

I was formerly a Computer Science Masters Student at the [[https://robotics.usc.edu/resl/][Robotic Embedded Systems Laboratory]] at the [[https://www.usc.edu/][University of Southern California]]. I spend a lot of time thinking about these domains:

- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Ethics of Artificial Ingelligence
- GNU/Linux

Here is my [[./data/amlesh_curriculum_vitae.pdf][resume]] if you're interested to learn more about me.

The site doesn't have much to offer yet besides a link to my GitHub profile where you can find projects I've worked on in the past. I also want to start writing some blog posts of things that interest me in the future.
